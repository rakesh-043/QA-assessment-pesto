Test Case Design: E-Commerce Website

Objective:
The objective of this document is to outline the test cases for validating the functionality, performance, security, and usability of the e-commerce website.

1. User Registration:

Positive Test Cases:
1. Verify that a new user can successfully register with valid information.
2. Confirm that the system displays an error message when attempting to register with an existing email address.
3. Check if the system enforces password complexity during registration.

Negative Test Cases:
1. Validate that registration fails with incomplete mandatory fields.
2. Confirm that the system prevents registration with an invalid email format.

2. Product Browsing and Searching:

*Positive Test Cases:*
1. Ensure that users can browse products by category and subcategory.
2. Verify that the search functionality returns relevant results based on product names and keywords.
3. Confirm that sorting options (e.g., price, popularity) work as expected.

*Negative Test Cases:*
1. Check that the system handles gracefully when searching for non-existing products.
2. Confirm that pagination controls work correctly when there are multiple pages of search results.

**3. Shopping Cart and Checkout Process:**

*Positive Test Cases:*
1. Validate that users can add products to the shopping cart.
2. Confirm that the cart updates dynamically when adding or removing items.
3. Verify that the checkout process completes successfully, including payment.

*Negative Test Cases:*
1. Check that the system prevents checkout with an empty shopping cart.
2. Validate error handling when payment fails during the checkout process.

**4. Order Management:

Positive Test Cases:
1. Confirm that users can view their order history.
2. Validate that users receive order confirmation emails.
3. Verify that order status is updated correctly (e.g., processing, shipped).

*Negative Test Cases:*
1. Ensure that unauthorized users cannot access other users' order history.
2. Check that the system handles gracefully when order status updates fail.

**5. Security and Privacy:**

*Positive Test Cases:*
1. Validate that user data is securely stored and encrypted.
2. Confirm that the login process is secure and prevents brute force attacks.

*Negative Test Cases:*
1. Attempt unauthorized access to user accounts with incorrect credentials.
2. Validate that the system does not expose sensitive information in error messages.

**6. Performance Testing:**

*Positive Test Cases:*
1. Validate that the website loads within an acceptable time frame under normal conditions.
2. Confirm that the system handles concurrent user sessions without significant performance degradation.

Negative Test Cases:
1. Test the website's performance under peak load to identify potential bottlenecks.
2. Validate the response time degradation under slow network conditions.

7. Usability Testing:

*Positive Test Cases:
1. Confirm that the website is responsive and displays correctly on various devices.
2. Validate that navigation is intuitive and user-friendly.

Negative Test Cases:
1. Test the website's usability under low bandwidth conditions.
2. Check for accessibility issues for users with disabilities.

8. Browser Compatibility:

Positive Test Cases:
1. Validate that the website functions correctly on the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

Negative Test Cases:
1. Identify and document any functionality discrepancies or layout issues on different browsers.

Review and Approval:

This test case design document requires review and approval from relevant stakeholders before the testing phase commences.
